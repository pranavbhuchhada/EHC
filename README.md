# EHC ( E - Health Card )
Digitalized Health Records

## Understanding The Problem

We have aadhar card , Pan card, Voter id, Driving licence like identity proofs for our
day to day transactions, but we have major missing that is our health card, which
manages our day to day health history like disease, allergy etc. And same card is used
everywhere in private and public hospitals and clinics, medical store, laboratory to
track your health related data , which the concern entity will enter in to the system.
This gives very huge and important data analytics using machine learning and AI like
City & Area wise allergy or disease etc. This will give on time information to health
authority so that , action can be taken on right time and thus it can save many people
to become victim of some viral disease. We aim to gather only health related data , so
we are not aiming to involve any economical transaction in to the system.
